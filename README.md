Robotics Assignments, WiSe2019, TU Berlin
Adding 5 Robotics Assignments completed as a part of Winter Semester Robotics Course at TU Berlin.
Adding small brief of each assignment
1. Assignment 1 : Calculate DH parameters and gravity vector of a 6 DOF PUMA robot. Implement a P, D controller and observe the behavior of the controller gains (tune the controller) on different joints
2. Assignment 2 : Forward kinematics. Calculating end effector Jacobian of a 6 DOF PUMA. Implementing a trajector generator using cubic splines. The end effector of PUMA moves in a circular motion
3. Assignment 3 : Control theory and visual servoing. Find circle feature so that end effector follows the circle
4. Assignment 4 : Mapping and localization. Particle filter
5. Assignment 5 : Implementing RRT extensions (Pathing)

P.S : All assignments contain a theory and an implementation part. While there could be some errors in the theoretical parts, the implementations are correct
